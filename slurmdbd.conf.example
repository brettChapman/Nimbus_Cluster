#                   Sample configuration file for slurmdbd
###############################################################################
#
# /etc/slurm-llnl/slurmdb.conf is an ASCII file which describes Slurm
# Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.
# The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of
# nodes and files. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is
# treated as a comment through the end of that line. The size of each
# line in the file is limited to 1024 characters. Changes to the
# configuration file take effect upon restart of SlurmDbd or daemon
# receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless otherwise noted.
#
# This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and
# should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g.
# "slurm"). This file should be protected from unauthorized access since
# it contains a database password.

# AuthType
# The  authentication  method  for  communications  between  Slurm  components.
# Acceptable  values  at  present  include  "auth/munge"  and "auth/none".  The
# default value is "auth/munge".  "auth/none" includes the UID in each communi‐
# cation,  but  it is not verified.  This may be fine for testing purposes, but
# do not use "auth/none" if you desire any  security.   "auth/munge"  indicates
# that  MUNGE  is  to  be  used.   (See "https://dun.github.io/munge/" for more
# information).  All Slurm daemons and commands must  be  terminated  prior  to
# changing the value of AuthType and later restarted.
AuthType=auth/munge

# AuthInfo
# Additional information  to  be  used  for  authentication  of  communications
# between  the Slurm daemons (slurmctld and slurmd) and the Slurm clients.  The
# interpretation of this option is specific to the configured AuthType.  Multi‐
# ple  options  may  be specified in a comma delimited list.  If not specified,
# the default authentication information will be used.
#
# cred_expire   Default  job  step  credential  lifetime,  in   seconds   (e.g.
# 		"cred_expire=1200").   It  must  be sufficiently long enough to
# 		load user environment, run prolog, deal with the slurmd getting
# 		paged  out  of  memory,  etc.   This  also  controls how long a
# 		requeued job must wait  before  starting  again.   The  default
# 		value is 120 seconds.
#
# socket        Path   name   to   a   MUNGE   daemon   socket   to  use  (e.g.
#		"socket=/run/munge/munge.socket.2").  The default value  is
# 		"/run/munge/munge.socket.2".    Used   by   auth/munge  and
# 		crypto/munge.
#
# ttl           Credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "ttl=300").  The  default
# 		value  is  dependent  upon the MUNGE installation, but is typi‐
# 		cally 300 seconds.
AuthInfo=/run/munge/munge.socket.2

# DbdHost
# The  short,  or  long, name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is
# executed (i.e. the name returned by the command "hostname -s").   This  value
# must be specified.
DbdHost=localhost

# DbdPort
# The  port  number  that  the  Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens to for
# work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system build time.
# If  none is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.  This value must be
# equal to the AccountingStoragePort parameter in the slurm.conf file.

# DebugLevel
# The level of detail to provide the Slurm Database Daemon's logs.  The default
# value is info.
#
# quiet     Log nothing
# fatal     Log only fatal errors
# error     Log only errors
# info      Log errors and general informational messages
# verbose   Log errors and verbose informational messages
# debug     Log errors and verbose informational messages  and  debugging  mes‐
#           sages
# debug2    Log  errors  and  verbose informational messages and more debugging
#           messages
# debug3    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more  debug‐
#           ging messages
# debug4    Log  errors and verbose informational messages and even more debug‐
#           ging messages
# debug5    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more  debug‐
#           ging messages
DebugLevel=info

# MessageTimeout
# Time permitted for a round-trip communication to complete in seconds. Default
# value is 10 seconds.

# StorageHost
# Define the name of the host the database is running where  we  are  going  to
# store the data.  Ideally this should be the host on which slurmdbd executes.
StorageHost=localhost

# StorageLoc
# Specify the name of the database as the location where accounting records are
# written. Defaults to "slurm_acct_db".
StorageLoc=slurm_acct_db

# StoragePass
# Define  the  password  used  to  gain access to the database to store the job
# accounting data. The '#' character is not permitted in a password.
StoragePass=password

# StoragePort
# The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd)  communicates  with
# the database.

# StorageType
# Define  the  accounting storage mechanism type.  Acceptable values at present
# include  "accounting_storage/mysql".   The  value  "accounting_storage/mysql"
# indicates  that  accounting  records  should be written to a MySQL or MariaDB
# database specified by the StorageLoc parameter.  This value  must  be  speci‐
# fied.
StorageType=accounting_storage/mysql

# StorageUser
# Define  the  name of the user we are going to connect to the database with to
# store the job accounting data.
StorageUser=slurm

# user other than "root" is recommended. The default value is "root".
